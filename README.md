# NOMA-for-5G
With an increase in the data traffic for 5G wireless communications, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) serves as a key technology to meet the overwhelming 
requirement of this data traffic. NOMA technique, by using superposition coding, multiplexes users in power domain at the transmitter, and allows users to share the 
same time/frequency resources, which can provide superior spectral efficiency compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access such as OMA. NOMA can 
deliver superior sum-rate with fixed power allocation.

This project introduces an overview of the concept, performance evaluation gains and our experimental 
trials related to NOMA like:
- Working with Superposition in NOMA
- Working with SIC in NOMA
- BER of multiple users using QPSK
- Power Allocation in NOMA
- SWIPT (Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer) - NOMA 
- MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) - NOMA
